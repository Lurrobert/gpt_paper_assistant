1. **Consciousness and Neural Network Models**:
   - Papers exploring the theoretical foundations of consciousness in AI, particularly focusing on how neural networks might mimic or replicate aspects of human consciousness.
   - Relevant studies might include examinations of self-awareness algorithms, consciousness modeling in neural networks, and the philosophical implications of conscious AI.

2. **Personal Data Utilization for AI Learning**:
   - Innovative approaches in utilizing personal life data for machine learning, with an emphasis on privacy and ethical considerations.
   - Relevant papers might cover topics like differential privacy in personal data usage, ethical frameworks for personal data in AI, and machine learning models that learn from personal context without compromising individual privacy.

3. **Generative Models for Personal Context Representation**:
   - Studies on generative models that can accurately represent and generate outputs based on a person's life context and experiences.
   - Look for research on advanced generative models in NLP and their applications in creating AI systems that understand and interact based on individual life contexts.

These suggestions align with your goal of building AI with consciousness and a system that leverages personal life context. They should provide a deep dive into the theoretical, ethical, and practical aspects of these advanced AI concepts.
